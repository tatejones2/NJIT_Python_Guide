## What is Python?

Python is a popular, high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and ease of use. It is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation, and more.

---

## Why Learn Python?

- Simple and readable syntax
- Large community and plenty of resources
- Versatile (web, data science, automation, etc.)
- In-demand skill for jobs

---

## Installing Python

1. Visit the [Python Downloads Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download the latest version for your operating system.
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts.
   - *Windows*: Ensure you check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
4. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

---

## Setting Up Your First Python Program

1. Open a terminal (or Command Prompt).
2. Open your text editor (Notepad, VSCode, PyCharm, etc.).
3. Create a file called `hello.py` with the following content:
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```
4. Run your program:
   ```bash
   python hello.py
   ```

---

## Python Syntax Basics

- Python uses indentation (spaces/tabs) to define code blocks.
- Lines do not end with semicolons.
- Comments start with `#`.

Example:
```python
# This is a comment
x = 5  # Assigns 5 to x
```

---

## Variables and Data Types

Python is dynamically typed â€” you don't declare variable types.

**Common Data Types:**
- `int` (Integer): `x = 5`
- `float` (Decimal): `y = 3.14`
- `str` (String): `name = "Alice"`
- `bool` (Boolean): `is_active = True`

---

## Operators

- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`
- Assignment: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.
- Comparison: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- Logical: `and`, `or`, `not`

---

## Control Flow (if, elif, else)

```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
elif x == 5:
    print("x is 5")
else:
    print("x is less than 5")
```

---

## Loops (for, while)

**For Loop:**
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

**While Loop:**
```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

---

## Functions

Define reusable blocks of code:
```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
```

---

## Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries

- **List**: Ordered, mutable collection
  ```python
  numbers = [1, 2, 3]
  ```
- **Tuple**: Ordered, immutable collection
  ```python
  point = (10, 20)
  ```
- **Dictionary**: Key-value pairs
  ```python
  person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
  ```

---

## Input and Output

**Input:**
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
```

**Output:**
```python
print("Hello,", name)
```

---

## Working with Modules

Import built-in or third-party libraries:

```python
import math
print(math.sqrt(16))
```

Install new modules with `pip`:
```bash
pip install requests
```

---

## Error Handling

Handle exceptions using `try` and `except`:

```python
try:
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
except ValueError:
    print("That's not a valid number!")
```

---

## Best Practices

- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Write comments and documentation
- Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guide

---

## Next Steps

- Practice writing and running simple programs
- Learn about object-oriented programming
- Explore file I/O and more advanced modules
- Work on small projects
